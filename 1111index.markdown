## <span class="showoff">My name is Will, and I work as a researcher and designer of services and experiences. It’s a difficult job to explain to family and friends.</span> 

### What is this
Recognising that a personal weblog in 2025 is both shouting at clouds, and a statement of interest, this site is to catalogue my interest in research, interaction design, and personal thought bubbles that need to get popped somewhere or other.

### Who am I 
I've already told you that. But I'm interested in how we all handle problems in our lives. A lot of these problems can be made easier through design, so I'm also interested in how organisations make decisions about which problems to solve.

### [The Work I've done](work.html)

 I have over 15 years’ experience in design and research. I ran an insight agency before focusing on design. There’s more info about all this on my Work page.

### [Writing & speaking](/writing)
 A weblog wouldn’t be a weblog without a sporadically-updated feed of thoughts, links and information on speaking engagements. 


#### What am I up to at the oment? 
I’m working at a consultancy called Valtech, and live in Somerset. You can read a bit more about [where I’m at right now](now.html).
